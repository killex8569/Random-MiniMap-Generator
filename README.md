# Random-MiniMap-Generator
Testing random generation and the use of noise for generating PNG map files (seed-based).


As part of my personal learning journey, I created this small project with the help of a tutorial. The future goal will be to complete and improve it.

# Update

My current goal is to improve it by adding the ability to create maps through a graphical interface built with custom Tkinter. I also plan to add a second version for caves, for example, in addition to terrain. Finally, I want to enable users to input their custom seed into the generator to create their own world
